# WhoooHQ's Dev Tryout

## What you need to do

You need to replicate [this layout (here)](https://github.com/whooohq/whq-dev-tryout/blob/master/whqdevtryout-demo.png?raw=true) as a homepage in a WordPress instance.

Here is the design [in Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/IBWdfY1kJcdPe4yd285QYI/Prueba?node-id=0%3A3&scaling=min-zoom).

Check the ```Assets``` folder for the required assets.

## Rules

1. It must be responsive. Need to look like the screenshot on Desktop, but it also need to adapt to Mobile without issues.
2. You have to use [Underscores](https://underscores.me) as a theme. Go to [Underscores](https://underscores.me) site and generate your own theme there. Hack and modify it as you like it after generating one.
3. For this test just keep it simple, there's no need to use a CSS Pre-processor or a complex JS Framework. If you need a CSS Framework to work, use Bootstrap 4 or 5. We use it as an Agency.
4. Must use as much as WP's capabilities as you need. Privilege WP's built-in features, like Pages, meta-boxes, posts, menus, Gutenberg blocks, proper theme URL calls, proper scripts and CSS enqueue, etc.
5. If needed, use the included ACF Pro plugin in this repo to extend WP's capabitilies to acomplish your vision. For example, to create [meta-boxes for the Home Page](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/adding-fields-posts/), to build some [Gutenberg blocks](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/), theme option pages, etc. What you need to accomplish the task. Don't need to go crazy creating a full page-builder experience with Gutenberg if you choose that path. Just the basic blocks to construct the Figma demo.
6. No page builders allowed. None.
7. Users (as admin) must be able to edit: logo, menu, texts and the hero-image's background info, just using WP's backend (wp-admin). Remember point 4.
8. Don't make the form functional. Not needed. Keep that as HTML only. We don't want to extend your test in that area. Don't worry. If you want to make it funcional, that's all right. It's Optional. But if you insist, you must use GravityForms (included in this repo), no other plugin for forms. As an Agency, we use it exclusively for our forms needs.
9. Don't need to make any internal page or extras. Links, like the menus, can just point to an empty # anchor. Again, we don't want to extend this test any longer for you. If you like, you can link menu items with anchors and auto-scroll to the corresponding section on the same home page, like a single page site. This is just optional.
10. Remember point 4, please. We are interested in seeing your general WordPress development skills. So please, code your own HTML/CSS/JS, use WP's features and try to follow [WP's coding standars](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/). This is important. Not knowing nor use WP's enqueue scripts, for example, is a no-no for us.

## Do your Tryout

You will have to have your own local development environment ready to work. If you don't have one, we recommend to use [Local WP](https://localwp.com/).

Install you own WordPress locally, use the required theme, use the optional plugins, don't forget the rules, and... go for it!.

This tryout shouldn't take more than 60 minutes to complete, if you know how to develop a basic WordPress theme.

## Deliver your Tryout

Once you are happy with your result, use [Duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/) to create a package, export it and deliver us a copy of your test (include both the installer.php and archive).

We will install your test and... test it. So we need all your files and DB for that.

Include the user/password to access the wp-admin.

You can upload you complete test to [WeTransfer](https://www.wetransfer.com/) and email us the link, please.
